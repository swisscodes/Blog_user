How to use view or create or delete contents
1. create and account using the signup form click on register
2. create a post/content. you can have it publish or draft.
3 you can click on the details of your post to edit or delete.

Next i will be adding a field for image and then create a thumpnail of image for each post to display the image field if image was uploaded 
else if image not uploaded i will have a place holder image.

Thank you.
